# Sysbot - GSoC 2018 Final Work Submission

### About

Systers being a vibrant open source community, participates in a lot of major 
open source programs throughout the year, like - Outreachy,RGSoC, GCI, GSoC etc.
These programs go on round the year and often even overlap. 

To maintain the quality, the mentors, admins and students try to clean the repositories and 
also at the same time aid the newcomers to get started, and get comfortable with the work flow. 
This becomes really hectic specially when transitioning fom one program to another.
Hence came the idea of Sysbot, which is a Slack-bot integrated with Github to streamline open source workflow.

A bot which was integrated with Slack and Github and could automate and pace up a lot of the work, and reduce load on mentors. 
It could also enforce certain essential practices for open-source, like PRs being sent to unreviewed issues,
or not being linked to issues at all, etc.
